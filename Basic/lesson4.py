"""                                     Mathematical Operations                         

Python provides built-in support for various mathematical operations through operators and functions. Here's an overview of the basic mathematical operations we can perform in Python:

1. Arithmetic Operators:

    Addition `+`: Adds two operands.
    Subtraction `-`: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
    Multiplication `*`: Multiplies two operands.
    Division `/`: Divides the first operand by the second.
    Floor Division `//`: Divides and returns the integer part of the quotient.
    Modulus `%`: Returns the remainder of the division.
    Exponentiation `**`: Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

"""

a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)   # Output: 13
print(a - b)   # Output: 7
print(a * b)   # Output: 30
print(a / b)   # Output: 3.3333333333333335
print(a // b)  # Output: 3
print(a % b)   # Output: 1
print(a ** b)  # Output: 1000

"""

2.Comparison Operators:

    Equal to `==`: Returns True if the operands are equal.
    Not equal to `!=`: Returns True if the operands are not equal.
    Greater than `>`: Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right.
    Less than `<`: Returns True if the left operand is less than the right.
    Greater than or equal to `>=`: Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.
    Less than or equal to `<=`: Returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.

x = 10
y = 20
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x != y)   # Output: True
print(x > y)    # Output: False
print(x < y)    # Output: True
print(x >= y)   # Output: False
print(x <= y)   # Output: True
